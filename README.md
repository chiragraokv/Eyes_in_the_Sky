Clone this repo and go through the example.py for a demonstration on how to decompress the sample input. The test cases are also compressed in the same format. It is recommended to use the same code for the solution.

This repo provides the sample input and python script to decrypt the LZMA-compressed text file provided.

The output of the function will be a 1D list containing the packed RGB values. The packed **RGB** represents the 3 channels as a single integer.

The placeholders (which are the **reference points identified**) are represented by orange color. R = 255, G = 165, B = 0.

All the best.
